## Active Task
✅ **COMPLETED**: Write tests for document ordering fix

## Status
✅ Completed

## Context & Progress
- Created: 2025-02-13
- I (AI) will maintain this document as we work together
- My current focus: Understanding and working on the active task

## Task History
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Add ability to generate AGENTS.md for Codex @https://platform.openai.com/docs/codex/overview#using_agents_md
  - Added `codex` field to all relevant TypeScript interfaces
  - Updated generator to create AGENTS.md when codex is enabled
  - Added `--codex` flag to CLI commands (init, generate, new)
  - Updated README documentation to include Codex in supported editors table
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for Codex functionality
  - All tests passing (46/46)
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Fix document ordering in generated files
  - Fixed issue where files were appearing in alphabetical order instead of source array order
  - Updated `expandAndDeduplicate` function to properly handle explicit files vs glob patterns
  - Explicit files maintain their order in the sources array
  - Glob patterns (like `docs/*.md`) get alphabetical ordering within their group
  - Fixed bug where `0` was being treated as falsy in the sorting logic
  - All tests passing (46/46)
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Write tests for document ordering fix
  - Added test case to verify explicit files maintain their order in sources array
  - Added test case to verify glob patterns are sorted alphabetically within their group
  - Both new tests are passing and verify the ordering functionality works correctly
  - All generator tests passing (16/16)

## Notes
- I'll update this file to track our progress and maintain context
- I'll keep sections concise but informative
- I'll update status and add key decisions/changes
- I'll add new tasks as they come up

## Next Steps
- Consider adding support for other AI editors as needed
- Monitor usage and feedback for the Codex integration
- Consider adding more customization options for AGENTS.md format if needed
